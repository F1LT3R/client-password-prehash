    <h3>Step 1 - Password</h3>

    <div class="col left">
      <p>Begin by creating a password. Your password must be
      a combination of the types of required characters
      on the right.</p>

      <label for="password"><b>Password: </b>
        <input type="password" id="password_box" />
      </label>

        <li class="requirement" id="numbers">Numbers (0-9)</li>
        <li class="requirement" id="special">Special characters (!@#$%...etc)</li>

    <h3>Step 2 - Keys</h3>

    <p>Choose three or more keys from the images below. <i>Make it memorable!</i> You will need to remember both: a) the images you choose, and <strong class="red">b) the order in which you chose them!</strong></p>

    <p><sup><b>WARNING: Only choose as many keys as you can remember.</b> If you loose your keys, your password will no longer work! Do not pick a sequence as the order of the images is randomized.</sup></p>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p class="disclaimer">
  	<b>Disclaimer:</b>
  	I am not, nor have ever been a security expert. Any ideas
  	expressed here are my own sentiments. My approach may simply
  	be wrong. If you know that to be the case, I would
  	appreciate an <a href="mailto:al@f1lt3r.com">email</a> :)
  </p>

  <div class="about">
	  <p><b>This is an experiment that aims to make passwords harder
	  for hackers to crack.</b></p>

	  <p>Passwords that are sent in plain-text are very vulnerable
	  to attack, obviously. While passwords that are sent over TLS,
	  are less vulnerable, but still able to be read as
	  plain-text using a MITM attack.</p>

	  <p>Once the password is stored on the server, it should be
	  salted (hashed with a key), so that that the password
	  residing on the server is not in plain-text should a hacker
	  gain access to the data.</p>

	  <p>However, if any of the users happen to use a easily
	  crackable password, such as: "Password1234!", and you have
	  used the same salt for all the users; then the hacker knows
	  all the passwords for all your users. The same is true if
	  the hacker gains the salt table.</p>

	  <p>Additionally, (and this was the purpose of me creating this
	  experiment), if someone gains access to the original password,
	  Eg: "Password1234!", then they likely have a password to other
	  services that the user has credentials for. Such as:
	  their email, bank account, social-media accounts, etc.</p>

	  <p>It is this network-effect of knowing a password that I was
	  particularly interested in overcoming.</p>

	  <p>The big idea here is to create a hash of the password
	  before it ever gets to the server, and adding
	  domain-specific complexity to the hash that would make
	  the cracking the password orders of magnitude harder,
	  and by prohibiting the re-use of cracked passwords.
	  (Once the hashed password is on the server, it can be
	  secured the usual ways, salted, etc.)</p>

	  <p>Each service that provides a login screen, could
	  customize the login process with a salt that is based on
	  the user input. In this demo I have chosen to use
	  image-keys to provide a further salt to the hashed
	  password.</p>

	  <strong>Outline of the method:</strong>

	  <ul>
	  	<li>Make sure the origin password has enough character length and complexity</li>
	  	<li>Use 4,321 rounds of SHA-512, to make the password-hash</li>
	  	<li>Randomize the key order and "hex-words" for each key, based on the seed of the password-hash</li>
	  	<li>Let the user pick any 3 or more key images (remembering order)</li>
	  	<li>Create a "sentence" of hex-words from the keys</li>
	  	<li>Use the sentence as a salt, to re-hash the password, using another 4,321 rounds of SHA-512 (this creates the output-hash)</li>
	  	<li>The output-hash is then used as the password that gets sent over TLS to the server</li>
	  	<li>The server then salts the output-hash, instead of a password</li>
	  </ul>

      <p>Now that all this work has been done on the front-end,
      the cracker would have to use a program that created
      tables of passwords, and use 4,321 rounds of SHA-512
      hashes to figure out the seed, then re-hash the password
      with `n` key combinations as the salt with another 4,321
      rounds of SHA-512. And assuming the randomizer is
      cryptographically built, I would think method should take
      a lot longer to crack.</p>

      <p>After the seed is guessed: you still have, 21 ^ 21
	  combinations of salts to guess, and hash again. Is this a
	  trivial feat for an attacker, I am not qualified to
	  understand.</p>

	  <h3>Shortcomings of This Method</h3>

	  <p>My hope that was that because the salt would be
	  domain-specific, and randomized by the user, that the
	  attacker would not be able to use the password on other
	  domains and services.</p>

	  <p>However: once the password is cracked, it would still
	  be usable on domains without domain-specific and
	  user-specific salting.</p>

	  <p>My first question is: whether the user and domain specific
	  input would increase the cracking difficulty with enough
	  orders of magnitude, to make the domain and user less
	  vulnerable to attack.</p>

	  <p>Is it any better than just upping the rounds?</p>

	  <p>My second question is: would this make things too hard
	  for the user (remembering the order of 3+ images)</p>

	  <p>Perhaps allowing users to value simplicity above security
	  is a flawed paradigm.</p>

	  <p>Whatever the case: because the hashes in transit are
	  both domain and user specific, I would think that finding
	  solutions to hashes with platforms like
	  <a href="http://md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html">
	  MD5-Online</a> or <a href="http://md5decrypt.net/en/Sha512/">
	  MD5 Decrypt</a> would become much harder, especially where
	  multiple services used similar (and slightly different)
	  techniques.</p>
